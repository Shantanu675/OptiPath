# OptiPath
OptiPath is a pathfinding visualization system that demonstrates shortest path algorithms through an interactive web interface. The system allows users to select cities on a graph and visualizes the optimal route calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, core components, and technology stack.

For detailed information about the frontend React components, see Core Components. For backend API implementation details, see API Controllers and Endpoints. For development setup instructions, see Development Environment.
